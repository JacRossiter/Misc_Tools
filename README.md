JExport is a MaxScript that allows users to export their meshes in a single click

JExport is a script that allows the user to export multiple objects in one click. Just select the objects you would like to export, toggle the fbx/obj button depending on the format you want, hit 'Export'. Your object will be exported to a folder called 'Export'. This folder can be accessed by clicking the 'Folder' Button. 
For added control you can enable 'Zero' which will zero the selected object to the centre of the grid before exporting and the restore the location afterwards. Prompt will enable the export options and allow the user to change settings (Disable prompt for the next export if you want to use the same settings).
